        <h2> <strong> Where I come from... </strong> </h2>
        <p> I am from Martinique, I was born here and I have lived there all my life. I have been living in Paris for 4 years now, because I wanted to study in a very good business school. I have a strong cultural bond with west indies, I truly love my island and I would like to live here after my studies. </p>

    	<h3> <strong> Formula 1 </strong> </h3>

        <img src="F12.jpg" height="280" width="180" alt="Formula 1">
    	<p class="hobbies"> I am found of Formula 1. I discovered this sport a few years ago and since then I have been a huge fan. I had the amazing opportunity to see a Grand Prix in Barcelone as you can see on the pictures above. I support Lewis Hamilton (and so Mercedes, first because he is the greatest of our era and second because he is the first black pilot in Formula 1 and diversity is an important cause for me. He brings something else than the other drivers in Formula 1 through his celebrity but also all his social fights. </p>  

    	<h3> <strong> Dogs </strong> </h3>

        <img src="dogs4.jpg" height=250 width="200" alt="Myisis & Nox">
        <p class="hobbies"> I absolutely LOVE dogs, I am a huge dog lover. I actually got two dogs, at my parents house in Martinique. They are both cane corsos, they are respectively 6 and 7 years. You can see them in the pictures above.</p>

    	<h3> <strong> Landscapes (in Martinique) </strong> </h3>

        <img src="vue4.jpg" height="250" width="180">
    	<p id="center"> I am passionnate about nature and landscapes. I grew up countryside and I have a need to see trees and grass and just something green where I live or else I do not feel good. I constantly need to have that connection with nature. In Martinique we see very often the kind of landscapes that calms you and makes you want to stop time.</p>

    	<h2> My travels </h2>
    	<p> Thanks to my parents, I have been able to travel a bit. I really love travelling, this is one of the things that I like to do the most. I guess it comes from the fact that I do not like to see or do the same things everyday, I need 'new'. I have lived in Amsterdam for 6months and that experience was incredible, I got to live a different way than I am used to. I met amazing people that I will never forget, I had a really good time. </p>
